    <p class="callout">Hello and thank you for looking at my water hunting tips.  I hope this page gives anybody that is interested in water hunting  useful information. I made this page to help all people interested in water hunting and needing answers to questions.</p>
    <ul class="no-bullet">
      <li><h4>Gear &amp; Safety</h4>

      </li>
      <li>
        No matter if wading or diving with a detector, NOTHING is worth your life.  If you get in any trouble DITCH your gear and FAST.   If you stay alive you can get it back.  Two people I knew personally have drowned while detecting and I heard from a wife of a third.  Safety should be your number one priority.  Water hunting is fun, rewarding, and dangerous.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you’re diving, have ALL the safety gear that is required for divers.  I don’t  care how deep you are 2‘– 120’ have a BC.  Know how to drop your weights and  know your surroundings.  Make SURE you have a BIG dive flag.  Don’t skimp on  this issue.  Boaters seem blind when it comes to things in the water.  It might  be legal to have a small one BUT it’s for your safety.  Boaters have to stay  150’ away, BUT most have NO idea what it is.  I have a 15” inner tube with cover  holding a 20 X 24 inch flag.  To have a tank filled you have to be certified.   Certifications last a lifetime.  But if you haven't dove for years, you might  want to take a refresher course.  If you are using a hookah,  a sea card isn't required BUT recomended for your safety and everyone with you.  You learn a lot  of safety tips and tricks and it really is for your benifit.
      </li>
      <li>
        I live by the most dangerous waterway in the USA.  The ONLY place in the USA a dive flag is NOT required to be within 150‘of you.  You couldn’t tow one around if you wanted to anyway.  But, you go in the water along the seawall and you had better come up along the seawall.  Boats will be going over top of you, but even the 1200’ freighters don’t get that close to the bottom and that’s where you had better be!!   If it’s in shallow water you need to be concerned about becoming propeller bait.  I dive with a detector that makes a beep ONLY when over a target.  Again personal preference BUT, I want to be able to hear wayward boats and or jet ski’s. I have been rolled over by a sailboat keel that hit my tank.  I am glad it wasn't my neck or head.
      </li>
      <li>
        My equipment consists of my scuba gear, my dive float and my detector. My dive float is multi purpose.  It tells boaters there is a diver in the area, and it holds a lot of my trash and large good finds.  I also carry a small mesh bag.
      </li>
      <li><h5 class="subheader">Wading</h5>
        If you’re wading, I seriously recommend an inflatable PFD.  They are under $100.00 and are well worth it, even if just for peace of mind.  Every Coast Guard and Sheriff patrol person wears them. No shame in being safe.
      </li>
      <li>
        When wading and detecting you have a choice of a wetsuit or waders for colder water. You can go deeper with a wetsuit, and if you do, sometimes you get more buoyant.  To compensate for that you can buy a weight belt and put a couple of two pound divers weights on it.  A diver’s weight belt is the ONLY thing I would recommend because it has a quick release buckle so you can drop it fast if you have to.
      </li>
      <li>
        Waders can fill up with water.  If the water is murky, <em>Don't venture deep unless you know the area.</em>  Prop washouts are frequent here and you can step in a hole and be in trouble.  Also be aware of drop-offs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Detectorists that wade need a long handled scoop.  Plenty of choices out there.  Most the good ones will set you back about $150.00.  Get one that you know is sturdy,  has a good warranty and feels like it will last you a lifetime.  Another usefull item you can use while wading is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUiiKwSYrls">floating sifter</a> that can easily be pulled behind you.  One is easily made with a 8' section of 3 or 4 inch PVC, 4 90 degree elbows, PVC glue, some zip ties and wire chcken mesh.  You can dump your scoop in it and let the water take out the sand and small gravel and leave your target in the sifter with maybe some rocks.
      </li>
      <li><h5 class="subheader">Snorkeling</h5>
        If you decide to try snorkeling with a machine, a wetsuit, booties, mask and snorkel, PFD, goodie bag, DIVE FLAG and detector are all you need. I know in Florida and Michigan a flag is required.  But, it doesn’t matter if it’s required or not.  It’s for your safety period.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once you see how easy it is to wave your hand above a target and have it appear, you will be hooked.  If you try to snorkel, there are two ways to keep your mask from fogging up.  You can buy anti fog gel from a scuba shop and rub it in your mask <em>before</em> you get it wet,  then rinse it out, or you can spit in it and rub it around and then rinse it out.  Both ways work.
      </li>

      <li><h4>Underwater Target Recovery</h4>
        Target recovery for divers or snorklers consists of three different ways that I use.  Again it’s personal  preference and a matter of choice.
      </li>
      <li>
        The easiest is in sand, you wave your hand over the sand and it makes a small crater and your target appears.  My favorite to see a gold ring appear. Do not dig with your bare hands!  Glass, rusted cans and shotgun shell bottoms are sharp and it's too easy to get cut.
      </li>
      <li>
        Next easiest is muck.  <em>Carfully</em> take handfuls of it in your hand and put them in front of your coil.  Once you have the target in your hand, put the whole handful in a small mesh bag you carry and hold the top closed.  Swish it in the water reach in and carfully take out your target.   In this case you need to carry two bags or have pockets in your BC you can put your targets in.
      </li>
      <li>
        Hardest is rocks.  They are packed together with sand in-between them and have to be moved.  Digging around them with your knife and moving them is one way to go.  Then fan the sand away and dig more.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once you swish or maybe even before, your visibility will be nil.  Relax and realize that after you get your target you can move to cleaner water if you want.  But, some targets are bottle tops on broken bottles and a lot of the time broken glass is in the muck.  Don’t squeeze it or scoop fast.  Slow and easy and you will never get cut.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ok so you fan the sand away and you reached clay and your target is still there.  I then take my dive knife and cut into the clay.  Again don’t try to dig with your hand.  Cuts can ruin your dive.  Most the targets are not too deep in the clay, they have just been stomped into the top layer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ok, you found your target and want to look at.  <em>Don't!</em>  As a diver, snorkeler or wader, you’re wasting air or hunting time.  You have plenty of time after to admire, look for karat marks or see what date it is after its time to quit or after you get home.  When I hunt, I hunt and just keep my finds in the bag.
      </li>
      <li>
        Am I lucky, yes.  Am I good, I believe I am.  I have about 8 years of water detecting now. I started out with a land detector, a White’s Spectrum that I drowned.  I moved up to a Whites DFX that I also drowned, got repaired by White’s and sold to buy my current machine.  I wish anybody luck that tries water detecting with a land machine.  Sooner or later if your like me its going to get wet.
      </li>
      <li><h4>Selling Items</h4>
        Selling your items. One word of advice, don’t be in a hurry.  Look at all your options and make an educated choice.  Jewelry stores, Pawn shops, We by gold places,  ALL will tell you they pay the highest price.  Find out what its worth before you talk to them.  You can visit<a href="http://www.dendritics.com/scales/metal-calc.asp"> this site</a>  to calculate the value of precious metals. You will need a scale which you can buy cheap on auction sites.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you’re diving, don’t overlook old bottles, lures, brass propellers and boat anchors and other things that land on the bottom.  Some also bring in nice amounts of money to pay for your adventures.  I save all my brass shotgun shell bottoms, shell casings and other odds and ends and put it all in a 5 gallon bucket.  I get around 70.00 for it at the scrap yard at the end of the season.  Enough for 10 – 15 tanks of air.
      </li>
      <li><h4>Finding Places to Hunt</h4>
        Want to get into places that are normally off limits to detectorists?   Make business cards.  Advertise that you find lost items or clean swim areas.  Go to association beaches, marina’s, stores by the water, dive shops,  and leave cards if you can.  Just might get you into spots that nobody has touched.
  </li>
  <li>
        I dive typically in 6 foot of water or less.  Is there more out deep?  The answer is yes!  But the targets are few and far between BUT well worth the effort if your patient.   Look for drop-offs, sunk 55 gallon drums (possibly held a floating dive platform)  and cut off dock pilings.  Just like on land, detecting anywhere somebody has been can be profitable.  But not like on land, anything that fell off a boat or a swimmer out deep was never found.
      </li>
      <li>
        Research, Research, Research.  That is the key.  Find old swimming holes.  If you don’t research go along a lake and don’t let the silence of your machine discourage you.  I guarantee you will stumble upon a swim area not used anymore and will find things that have been lost for centuries.
      </li>
      <li><h4>Know the Laws</h4>
        Know the laws in your area concerning water hunting, trespassing, lost items like guns.  If possible keep a copy of all the laws you find in your vehicle.  Cops <em>do not</em> know all the laws and unfortunately sometimes make up their own.  And if your profitable and are persistent, sooner or later you will meet up with an officer.  You can also make up a written permission slip for private lakes.  I have one and so far it has gotten me into two by knocking on doors.  Have both parties names on it,  date it was signed,  a disclaimer stating you do not hold the homeowner responsible for any accident you might have on their property.  I also have my phone number on it and I give them a copy.  You meet a lot of great people that live along the lake shores.  You also meet people that think they own the whole lake.
      </li>
      <li>
        I <a href="gallery.php">give back</a>.  I have returned over 35 gold class rings and two silver ID bracelets.  That is my choice.  It has also opened many doors to me that  allowed me into places nobody else can detect in.  That is personal preference and its all up to you to decide what is right for you.
      </li>
      <li>

        Be safe,  have fun and no matter if you find anything or not enjoy yourself.  Good luck!
