        My hometown is Port Huron, Michigan.  Home of the most dangerous navigatable waterway in the United States.  While diving, 1,200 foot freighters go right over top of you.  The current fast and unpredictable.  This is where Lake Huron empties into the St. Clair River.  Sarnia, Canada is on the other side of the bridges.  It is impossible to swim against the current here and you have to be super careful it doesn't rip your mask off if you look behind you.
